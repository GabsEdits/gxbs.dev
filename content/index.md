Salut! I'm **Gabriel**, also known as **Gabs** in my digital world. Yeah, I'm a human person, but also a designer and developer with a passion for creating beautiful and intuitive experiences. Proudly navigating the world of development here, in Moldova. Creating visually stunning and user-friendly web experiences is what I lobe. You can peek into my coding contributions by looking at [my Forges Profiles](/findme#contributions), most of the project are on **GitHub**.

> GitHub is basically my home, but for code! It's like my coding playground, I might be a little too attached to it. But hey, can you blame me? <small>Maybe just a bit, I am looking at [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/) for the future</small>

::: details A story of my journey
Let's fast forward to May 2023. That's when something amazing happened. I went beyond my personal space and created something truly remarkable. Aeolus – a powerful framework built with Vue.js 3 & Vite, exclusively for Boekestijn in Moldova. The success of this project fueled my desire to take on more professional work, especially for other companies. But Aeolus didn't quite take off and wasn't easy enough to reproduce the components on a shiny new webpage. I decided to start an new adventure called [Aplóe](https://aploe.gxbs.me), aimed at solving the main issue with Aeolus – the lack of unified styles and **If you need a website, don't hesitate to [contact me](/findme).**

Take a closer look at my [projects & contributions](/projects). It's more than just code; it's a reflection of my passion. Occasionally, you might even find me translating one project to another, although not very often.

> If you have a project that needs a little extra love, feel free to [reach out](/findme). I love contributing to open-source projects and I'm always on the lookout for new opportunities to help out.

I occasionally write about tech, development, and open-source on my [blog](/blog/), that you can also subscribe to via [RSS/Atom Feed](/atom.xml). You can check it out if you're interested in learning more about my work and the projects I'm involved in, or if you just want to read some cool stories about my journey in the tech world.

In addition to coding, I also ~~slightly~~ enjoy photography. You can find a small collection of my favorite shots on my [Photography Gallery](https://photo.gxbs.me). <small>While it's not much, and not my main focus, I still enjoy capturing moments.</small>

For web development enthusiasts, have a look on [my tips and tricks](https://tips.gxbs.me) page, mainly for CSS/SCSS and development in general. You can check it out! <small>It's a work in progress, but I'm getting there.</small>

Now, when I'm not in coding mode, you'll find me immersed in the ever-evolving world of technology. Learning new skills is not just a hobby; it's my way of trying to make a positive impact through my work \:D :rocket:
