Aplós has been a project that I have been working on for a while now. It has been a great learning experience for me, and I have learned a lot from it. Since the start of the project, a lot has changed in terms of how the general structure of the project is, and it's next steps.

Recently, I've released the second major version of Aplós, which brought a lot of changes to the project. Since the big migration to becoming a NPM package, the project is now more modular, and it's easier to add new features to it. The project is now more stable, and it's easier to maintain.

Since my last blog about Aplós ([Behind Aplós](/blog/posts/behind-aplós)), a lot has changed:

- Became an NPM package
- Support for articles and comments
- More customization options
- The `minimal` and `basic` layouts
- Various bug fixes and improvements
- Various new elements and components
- Image customization options through the URL
- Way better accessibility
- **And much more!**

Aplós has come a long way since the start of the project, and I am quite happy with how it has turned out. However, there are still some things that I want to do with the project.

## Next Steps

The next steps for Aplós are quite simple. I want to make the project more modular and easier to use. I want to make it easier to add new features to the project, and I want to make it easier to maintain.

That comes with the limitation of VitePress, the current static site generator that Aplós is a theme for. VitePress is a great static site generator, but it has some limitations. And I was thinking about moving to a new base, made from scrath, for Aplós.

### Safí

Safí (Clean in Greek) will be the successor of Aplós. It will be a new base for Aplós, and it will be made from scratch. Safí will use Nuxt as the base, and it will be more modular and easier to use.

Nuxt already provides [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/), which is a great way to manage content in a Nuxt project. Safí will use Nuxt Content as the base for managing content, and it will be easier to add new features to the project.

Safí will also be more customizable, and it will be easier to maintain. It will be easier to add new features to the project, and it will be easier to maintain.

If Safí is successful, Safí will become the new Aplós. The current Aplós will be archived, and Safí will take the name "Aplós". The current Aplós will still be available, but it will not receive any new features or updates.

Of course, all of this is still just an idea, and didn't get to the point to actually start working on it. But I am quite excited about the idea of Safí, and I am looking forward to working on it.

If everything goes well, inital development will take place on [aplosdev/safi](https://github.com/aplosdev/safi) repository. We will see how it goes from there.

I will write more posts about it if it turns into a reality. Till then, stay tuned! 🚀
