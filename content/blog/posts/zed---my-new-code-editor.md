Up until very recently, I was using Visual Studio Code as my main code editor, and I was quite happy with it. And I even used <abbr title="Visual Studio Code">VsCode</abbr> (and it's forks like [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com)) for a long time, and I actually never used anything else for a long time, nor did I want to.

Then, I stumbled upon [Zed](https://zed.dev), after ~~hearing~~ seeing a few people talking about it on Mastodon and other groups I was in. I decided to give it a try, and I was quite impressed with it.

For starters, Zed is a code editor that is built with web technologies, and it's both fast and lightweight. It has a lot of features that I like, such as a _very_ minimalistic UI, extensions, themes and a blazing fast speed (basically instant in any way).

Given that I like simple and minimalistic things, Zed was a perfect fit for me. So I gave it a try.

## Using it

I've started to use Zed, and I love multuple things about it. Such as these features:

- **Themes\***: Zed has a lot of themes to choose from, and I like that. I'm currently using the deafult theme, and I love it.

- **Extensions\***: Zed has a lot of extensions, and I like that. Extensions always help.

- **Speed**: Zed is very fast.

- **UI**: Zed has a minimalistic UI.

- **Customization**: Zed is very customizable.

- **Open Source**: Zed is open source.

- And overall the experience is great.

\* - (It's one step closer to fully being a VSCode replacement for me)

## Conclusion

After being a long-time Visual Studio Code user, I can say that I'm quite happy with Zed, and I'm planning to use it as my main code editor from now on. Might sometimes open VSCode, but Zed will be my favorite. I like it a lot, and I recommend it to anyone who wants a fast, lightweight and minimalistic code editor.
